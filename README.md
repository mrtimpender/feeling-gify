# api traversal


#### Instructions:

make an api call to grab a movie form a text field and then
hit omdapi get a movie :
http://www.omdbapi.com/?s=minions


and then append to a central div all of the images that match the title.
The titles and images of each movie should be in ONE central column
that goes down the middle of the page. When you scale to mobile, the column
should remain in the middle of the page. If there's no image for a movie,
use the "not shown" image.

If you have time, build a media query so that the images and titles get
slightly smaller if viewing on a phone.




See mockup for example of how the image column should look.

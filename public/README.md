# Description:
Feeling GiF-y?
A daily check-in app that a user would use to log how they are feeling on a certain day.  This would then return a selection of GIFs for them to select.  This would record that GIF in a calendar.  Users would then be able to query their GIF feelings for the most recent week or month.  

# Technologies:

# MVP:
